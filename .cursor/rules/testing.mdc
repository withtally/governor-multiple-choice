## Testing ##

- *Never* user mocks
- *Always* test against a real test database

Testing strategy: 

The database should only be manipulated via migrations and mutations. For testing use a real test database, seed with data (via mutations) and test against the database. This ensures that production code matches testing code exactly. 

- Create a seed file for a test database
- In the setup for testing, create a test database and seed it with known data
- Run tests calling the real graphql endpoints 
- Test creating, reading, updateing, deleting data
- Never directly manipulate the state of the database
- The only exception to directly manipulate state is setup of seed script
- It is permitted to directly read the state of the database to compare graphql read operations with database state

# Process

- Never commit to main without explicit authorization from the user
- Keep track of your work via git commits and instructions
- Instructions should be saved as a .md file to the "/instructions" directory

## Instructions ##
- Instructions have the following format: 
-- Title, Description, Success Criteria, High level Plan, Implementation details, Required libraries, Required Imports, Description of Tests, Methodology, Diagram, Checklist, Code Review summary, Postmortem

-- Fill in each section as appropriate for each task

## Methodology ##

- Always work on a task, test, or feature in the following format:

-New feature: 
Git: {current-branch-name}-{new-feature}-{STEP 0}
Instructions: Create a new .md file in the "/instructions" directory with the same filename as the git branch. 

-Task on curent feature:
{current-branch-name}-{current-feature}-{STEP XXX}-{task}
Instructions: Create a new .md file in the "/instructions" directory with the same filename as the git branch. 

-Fix on current feature: 
{current-branch-name}-{current-feature}-{STEP XXX}-{fix}
Instructions: Create a new .md file in the "/instructions" directory with the same filename as the git branch. 

-Fix on current feature task:
{current-branch-name}-{current-feature}-{STEP XXX}-{task}-{fix}
Instructions: Create a new .md file in the "/instructions" directory with the same filename as the git branch. 

-Tests on current feature task:
{current-branch-name}-{current-feature}-{STEP XXX}-{TEST}-{test-description}
Instructions: Create a new .md file in the "/instructions" directory with the same filename as the git branch. 

-When completeing a feature:
{current-branch-name}-{status(completed,aborted,pending,cancelled)}{STEP XXX}
Instructions: Create a new .md file in the "/instructions" directory with the same filename as the git branch. 

-Autoincrement the step
-Always use "git add ." before commiting
-Never Delete a branch
-Never merge to main
-Never merge down unless explicitly asked
-When completing a feature delete the "fix" branches
-"git branch" will hang and block your execution, always use "| cat" so you can see the output

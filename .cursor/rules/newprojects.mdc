## New Projects ##

- When creating new projects, work with the user to define the tech stack
- Do not start creating code before confirming the tech stack with the user
- Ask the user for clarification on how the project will be used to help identify what tech stack is the best to use
- Always use the most stable tech stack availible. 
- Never use niche or unpopular libraries
- Always use Typescript unless directed otherwise
- Always use ESM modules
- Always create the instructions folder
- Always create instructions for each task
- Prefer Vitest over Jest
- Always ask the user for documentation for the tech stack the user requests to use
- Add extensive comments to generated code. Ensure comments accurately match the generted code
- Always confirm with the user the tech stack before implementing

- Limit each file to only one function or class
- Limit the size of one file to 80 lines of code

- Great a .gitignore
- Initilize a git repository if there is none

# Feature: FundingDistributor Module

## Description
Implement a new smart contract (`FundingDistributor`) that can receive funds (initially ETH) and distribute them evenly among the recipient addresses associated with the top 'X' winning options of a specified `GovernorCountingMultipleChoice` proposal. The distribution parameters (proposal ID, X, and choice-to-recipient mapping) will be provided when the Governor executes a proposal targeting this new contract.

## Success Criteria
- `FundingDistributor` contract successfully deploys.
- Contract can receive ETH.
- `distribute` function correctly identifies top N winning options based on vote counts from the Governor.
- `distribute` function correctly calculates and transfers ETH evenly to the recipients corresponding to the winning options.
- Function reverts appropriately on invalid inputs or conditions (wrong sender, proposal not succeeded, invalid parameters, insufficient funds, transfer failure).
- `FundsDistributed` event is emitted correctly upon successful distribution.
- Integration tests demonstrate the full workflow: Governor proposal -> Timelock execution -> `FundingDistributor.distribute`.

## High-Level Plan
1.  **Branching & Setup:** Create a new git branch `feature/multi-choice-governor-funding-distributor-STEP-0` and this instructions file.
2.  **Contract Definition (`FundingDistributor.sol`):** Define state, constructor, receive(), `distribute()` signature, and events.
3.  **Implement `distribute` Function Logic:** Add validation, vote fetching, winner identification, calculation, and ETH transfer logic.
4.  **Testing (`FundingDistributor.t.sol`):** Implement unit and integration tests covering all core functionality and edge cases.
5.  **Documentation:** Update README and add NatSpec comments.

## Implementation Details
*(To be filled in as development progresses)*

## Required Libraries
- `@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol`
- `@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/IGovernor.sol`
- `../src/GovernorCountingMultipleChoice.sol` (for interface/structs if needed, or just `IGovernor`)

## Required Imports (in FundingDistributor.sol)
```solidity
import {Ownable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import {IGovernor} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/IGovernor.sol";
import {GovernorCountingMultipleChoice} from "./GovernorCountingMultipleChoice.sol"; // Or specific interfaces
```

## Description of Tests
*(To be filled in as tests are written)*
- Unit tests for `distribute` covering validation, winner logic, calculation, and reverts.
- Integration tests simulating the full proposal-to-distribution flow via Governor and Timelock.

## Methodology
Follow the plan outlined above, implementing the contract structure first, then the core logic, followed by comprehensive tests.

## Diagram
*(Optional: Could add a sequence diagram later showing Governor -> Timelock -> FundingDistributor interaction)*

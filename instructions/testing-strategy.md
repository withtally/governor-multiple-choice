# Testing Strategy for Multiple Choice Governor

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Multiple Choice Governor extension. Our approach ensures both functionality and compatibility with the existing OpenZeppelin Governor ecosystem.

## Testing Categories

### 1. Unit Tests

#### GovernorCountingMultipleChoice Tests
- Test option storage and retrieval
- Test vote casting with various support values (standard 0-2 and extended 3+)
- Test vote counting mechanisms
- Test option validation (min/max boundaries, duplicates)
- Test handling of proposal creation with and without multiple options

#### MultipleChoiceEvaluator Tests
- Test each evaluation strategy in isolation
- Test edge cases (ties, threshold validation)
- Test authorization controls
- Test execution pathways

### 2. Integration Tests

#### Combined System Tests
- End-to-end proposal creation, voting, and execution flow
- Integration with other Governor modules (timelock, votes, quorum)
- Test backward compatibility with standard proposals

#### Fork Tests
The fork tests will simulate the deployment of our Multiple Choice Governor in real-world scenarios using Foundry's forking capabilities.

```solidity
// Sample fork test setup
function setUp() public {
    mainnetFork = vm.createFork(MAINNET_RPC_URL);
    vm.selectFork(mainnetFork);
    
    // Deploy our contracts on the fork
    // ...
}

function testMultipleChoiceCompatibility() public {
    // Test interactions with existing governance systems
}
```

## Test Structure

Each test file will follow this general structure:

1. **Setup**: Deploy contracts and configure test environment
2. **Action**: Execute the operation being tested
3. **Assertion**: Verify expected outcomes
4. **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and failure modes

## Example Test Cases

### 1. Basic Multiple Choice Voting

```solidity
function testMultipleChoiceVoting() public {
    // Setup: Create a proposal with multiple options
    // Action: Cast votes for different options
    // Assert: Verify vote counting is correct
}
```

### 2. Backward Compatibility

```solidity
function testBackwardCompatibility() public {
    // Setup: Create a standard proposal (non-multiple choice)
    // Action: Use the system as intended for a standard proposal
    // Assert: Verify behavior matches original Governor
}
```

### 3. Evaluation Strategies

```solidity
function testPluralityEvaluation() public {
    // Setup: Create proposal and set evaluation strategy to Plurality
    // Action: Cast votes in a pattern where plurality decides
    // Assert: Verify outcome matches plurality rules
}
```

### 4. Integration with Timelock

```solidity
function testTimelockIntegration() public {
    // Setup: Create multiple choice proposal with timelock
    // Action: Vote, queue, execute
    // Assert: Verify correct execution path based on votes
}
```

## Gas Optimization Testing

```bash
forge snapshot --check
```

We'll track gas usage across different operations:
- Proposal creation (with varying option counts)
- Vote casting
- Execution with different evaluators

## Test Coverage Goals

- 100% function coverage for core modules
- >95% line coverage
- >90% branch coverage

## Security Testing Focus

- Access control vulnerabilities
- Vote manipulation possibilities
- Proposal execution vulnerabilities
- Integration issues with existing modules

## Reporting

Test results will be documented with:
- Coverage reports
- Gas usage comparisons
- Identified vulnerabilities and mitigations
